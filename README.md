# Financial Focus (FinFocus)

## About

FinFocus is a trusted provider of financial news and services for individuals and businesses alike.

The cost of living has been increasing globally in recent years, due to a variety of factors such as inflation, rising prices for essential goods and services, and the devaluation of local currencies. This has led to a strain on household budgets and has significant implications for many individuals and families, particularly those on fixed incomes or those living in poverty. The rising cost of living has also been a major contributor to growing income inequality, as those at the lower end of the income spectrum struggle to keep up with the increasing costs of housing, and other essentials.
There is so much the government can do to help struggling households and it is up to individuals to explore ways of how to bring in additional income to hopefully help ease their financial struggles. At FinFocus, our mission is to help our those impacted navigate the challenges of the current global economic landscape, and to provide them with the resources they need to achieve financial stability and security.
